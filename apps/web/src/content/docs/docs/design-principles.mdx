`bejamas/ui` is an Astro-native component library. The way components are structured is as important as how they look.

1. **Folder-per-component structure.** Each component family lives in its own folder (e.g., `card/`, `dialog/`). Sub-components are separate `.astro` files, and the folder exports them via a barrel `index.ts` file.
2. **Docs in code.** Documentation is auto-generated from comments within each component file; there's no separate source of truth to maintain.
3. **Themeable.** Components use token-based classes (e.g. `bg-background`, `text-primary`) instead of hard-coded colors.
4. **Composable.** We prefer small primitives over heavy abstractions. Code should be easy to read, copy, and modify.
5. **Astro-native, zero-JS by default.** Components are server-first and ship no client JavaScript unless they truly need it.
6. **Framework-agnostic.** We don't bundle React, Vue, or any other client framework. You're free to add your own [Astro islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) or framework of choice on top where needed.
7. **shadcn/ui aligned.** We follow shadcn's markup patterns and class naming where useful, so you can reuse component examples and patterns from the shadcn registry and adapt them easily for Astro.

## Composition

React libraries often use subcomponents:

```tsx
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardDescription,
} from "@bejamas/ui/components/card";

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
</Card>;
```

In Astro, we use the same pattern with barrel exports:

```astro
---
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardDescription,
  CardContent,
  CardFooter,
} from "@bejamas/ui/components/card";
---

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Description</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>

  <CardContent> Card content </CardContent>

  <CardFooter> Footer actions </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

Here:

- `Card` is the root card container.
- `CardHeader` renders the header section and contains `CardTitle` and `CardDescription`.
- `CardContent` and `CardFooter` are sibling sections within the card.

Each subcomponent is its own `.astro` file within the `card/` folder, and all are exported from `card/index.ts`.

### How the folder structure works

Each component family has its own folder:

```
components/
├── card/
│   ├── Card.astro
│   ├── CardHeader.astro
│   ├── CardTitle.astro
│   ├── CardDescription.astro
│   ├── CardContent.astro
│   ├── CardFooter.astro
│   └── index.ts
├── button/
│   ├── Button.astro
│   └── index.ts
└── ...
```

The `index.ts` barrel file exports all subcomponents:

```ts
export { default as Card } from "./Card.astro";
export { default as CardHeader } from "./CardHeader.astro";
export { default as CardTitle } from "./CardTitle.astro";
export { default as CardDescription } from "./CardDescription.astro";
export { default as CardContent } from "./CardContent.astro";
export { default as CardFooter } from "./CardFooter.astro";
```

This gives us:

- clear, predictable import paths,
- each subcomponent is focused and easy to understand,
- users can import just what they need,
- and consistent patterns across all component families.

### Why use separate files?

We split components into separate files because:

1. **Each file is focused.** `CardTitle.astro` only handles the title - its props, styles, and behavior are all in one place.
2. **Import only what you need.** If you only use `Card` and `CardContent`, you don't need to import the others.
3. **Easier to extend.** Adding a new subcomponent means creating a new file and adding it to the barrel export.
4. **Better IDE support.** Separate files give better autocomplete and jump-to-definition behavior.

### Consistent patterns across components

All multi-part components follow the same structure:

```astro
---
// Dialog
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogContent,
  DialogFooter,
} from "@bejamas/ui/components/dialog";
---

<Dialog id="myDialog">
  <DialogTitle>Dialog Title</DialogTitle>
  <DialogDescription>Dialog description text.</DialogDescription>
  <DialogContent>
    <p>Dialog body content goes here.</p>
  </DialogContent>
  <DialogFooter>
    <button data-dialog-close>Close</button>
  </DialogFooter>
</Dialog>
```

```astro
---
// Select
import {
  Select,
  SelectControl,
  SelectOption,
  SelectIndicator,
} from "@bejamas/ui/components/select";
---

<Select>
  <SelectIndicator />
  <SelectControl>
    <SelectOption value="apple">Apple</SelectOption>
    <SelectOption value="banana">Banana</SelectOption>
  </SelectControl>
</Select>
```

This consistency makes the library predictable - once you learn one component, you know how to use them all.
