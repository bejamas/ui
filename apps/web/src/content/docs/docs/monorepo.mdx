`bejamas/ui` works good in a monorepo setup. In fact, it's the recommended way to use it.

### Create a new monorepo project

To create a new monorepo project, run the `init` command. You will be prompted
to select the type of project you are creating.

```bash
npx bejamas@latest init
```

Select the `Astro (Monorepo)` option.

```bash
? Would you like to start a new project?
    Astro
❯   Astro (Monorepo)
    Astro with Component Docs (Monorepo)
```

This will create a new monorepo project with two workspaces: `web` and `ui`,
and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) as the build system.

Everything is set up for you, so you can start adding components to your project.

Note: The monorepo uses Astro v5 and Tailwind CSS v4.

### Add components to your project

To add components to your project, run the `add` command **in the path of your app**.

```bash
cd apps/web
```

```bash
npx bejamas@latest add [COMPONENT]
```

The CLI will figure out what type of component you are adding and install the
correct files to the correct path.

For example, if you run `npx bejamas@latest add button`, the CLI will install the button component under `packages/ui` and update the import path for components in `apps/web`.

If you run `npx bejamas@latest add hero-01`, the CLI will install the `button`, `label`, `input` and `card` components under `packages/ui` and the `hero-01` component under `apps/web/components`.

### Add components to your project

To add components to your project, run the add command in the path of your app.

The CLI will figure out what type of component you are adding and install the correct files to the correct path.

For example, if you run `npx bejamas add button`, the CLI will install the button component under `packages/ui` and update the import path for components in apps/web.

If you run `npx bejamas add login-01`, the CLI will install the button, label, input and card components under `packages/ui` and the login-form component under `apps/web/components`.
