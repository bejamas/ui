`bejamas/ui` uses CSS variables as its theming layer.  
All components read from the same token set, so updating the theme updates the entire UI.

This page explains where themes live, how to override them, and how to create multiple brand themes.

## Where Themes Live

By default, tokens are defined in:

<DocsTabs>
  <DocsTabItem label="Non-Monorepo">```/src/styles/globals.css```</DocsTabItem>
  <DocsTabItem label="Monorepo">
    ```shell /packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css ```
  </DocsTabItem>
</DocsTabs>

This file contains all base variables (colors, radii, spacing, etc.).  
Anything you override here becomes the new global theme.
